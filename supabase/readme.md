# PsychRoadMap Backend

The backend for the PsychRoadMap application is managed via Supabase

## Setup

For local development you'll want to install two packages.

- `supabase-cli`
- `docker`
- `deno`

Instructions will vary by system so just look it up.

## Run Unit Tests

inside the `supabase/` directory (this one), run `deno test --allow-all`. Make sure to fill out the `.env` file with the correct information.
