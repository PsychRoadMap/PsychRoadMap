3/2 select.jsx
  Checkbox interferes with accordion behavior such that the accordion opens/closes when checkbox is clicked.
  Clicking the label checks the associated checkbox without triggering the accordion.
  Putting the <input> inside of the label does not fix this behavior.

  <fix>

3/2 select.jsx
  Routing to selection page disables accordion Javascript (or causes it to malfunction in some way). 
  Page must be refreshed while select.jsx is rendered to enable Javascript.

  Fixed by switching to flowbite-react accordion component. Tradeoff is that the accordion is no longer nested.

3/9 index.jsx
  On mobile view, when phone is turned sideways, the GET STARTED button is not centered. 
  
  Fixed by adjusting CSS
