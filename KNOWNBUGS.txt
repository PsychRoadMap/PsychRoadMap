2/28 select.jsx
  Routing to selection page disables accordion Javascript (or causes it to malfunction in some way).
  Page must be refreshed while select.jsx is rendered to enable Javascript.
  Would likely be fixed with proper use of useState() and useEffect(). Currently using reloadDocument hack, but would like to fix this correctly.
  Problematic behavior is not present when using proper React Accordion component, but I cannot for the love of god get that fucker styled. 
  We will have to switch the proper component anyway once the database is in a usable state, so I have until then to figure the styling out.

2/18 index.jsx
  On mobile view, when phone is turned sideways, the GET STARTED button is not centered. 
  Centering this button conflicts with the desktop view in a strange way. Likely just requires some careful CSS to fix.
